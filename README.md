# Lucio

## What?
Lucio is **intended to be** a Lisp-like language and also a parser developed in Ruby only for knowledge and fun. No profit intended.

## Why?
From Latin, Lucius means _Light_, because this development is enlightening my (poor) knowledge about programming languages, parsing and related subjects.
Lucio is also the name of one of the most important teachers I had, and I found this as a kind of homage.
The last, but not least, reason is to practice TDD, since I'm developing all the code using test-first.

## When?
Lucio is developed in my almost nonexistent spare time as a way to keep me learning and passionate with software development. 

## Who?
I'm just an ordinary software developer, passionate and curious. If you want to collaborate, fork this and start to code. Simple.
